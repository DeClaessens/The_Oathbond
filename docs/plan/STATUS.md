# Project status — single source of "where are we"

One page, always current. Any session (human or agent) starting work reads
this first instead of re-deriving state from git history. **Whoever merges a
story or closes a decision updates this file in the same commit.**

Last updated: 2026-07-11 (M2.4 + M2.6 merged).

## Where we are

- **M1 — Persistence is code-complete.** M1.2 (character save/load) merged
  to `main` 2026-07-08 after two-axis review; suite green (218/218). The M1
  exit criterion — quit and resume a character, account file exists — awaits
  Thomas's in-game quit→relaunch check.
- **M2 — Loot & inventory design pass (M2.1) done 2026-07-08.** ADR-0016
  (derived stats), ADR-0017 (crit), attribute names locked (Might/Grace/Wit),
  and four `ready-for-agent` briefs (M2.2–M2.5). M2.5 (crit & stat roster)
  merged 2026-07-08. M2.2 (attributes) merged 2026-07-08; M2.3 (drops &
  inventory) in progress. M2.4 (equip gate) and M2.6 (skills window) merged
  2026-07-11.
- M0 (Combat completeness) merged 2026-07-07; its playable exit criterion
  lives in the proving-grounds level (`levels/`) with the Slime.

## Human queue (Thomas)

1. **M1 exit check** — play, gain a level, quit (window close — editor-stop
   doesn't save, by design), relaunch: level/XP/pools/equips resume. Closes
   Epic M1 and ungates the M2.1 design pass.
2. **M0.7 death-penalty decision** — the fight–die–level loop is playable;
   decide and close the VISION open question.
3. **Feel pass on M0** — GCD 0.4s cadence, Slime chase/bite tuning, camera
   feel. Tuned by play, not by test (`docs/handoff/README.md`).
